# Defence Robot for LandMine and Fire Detection
IoT Based Major Project (Undergrad)
## Abstract<br>
Land mine detection is most crucial during warfare to deploy armed vehicle 
drive in the enemy territory. These armed vehicle or Main battle tanks are used to 
follow the path of pilot tanks operated manually to avoid damage/distraction of the 
battle tank and defence casualties of defence crews. In addition post warfare the mines 
planted during war can be detected and diffused by deploying a mine detection robot, 
which can save civilian life to avoid human casualties. 
In our proposed system, the robot can be controlled by an application from a 
safe distance. The landmine and fire are detected in the targeted area. The landmine can 
be detected using the metal sensor and the fire can be detected using the fire sensor. The 
robot can be controlled and taken to a place where the humans canâ€™t reach and detect 
the fire and landmine.
